                Hey Pranati,<br><br>
From just our short chat, I feel like you have this calm and thoughtful vibe that makes talking to you so easy. It’s like the kind of connection you don’t come across every day—warm and real. 💛

"Don’t Look Back in Anger" by Oasis.....I looked it up, and it feels like such a heartfelt song about letting go and embracing life. It already makes me curious about why it’s your pick—maybe you can tell me the story behind it someday? 🤗 

And your perfect weekend? Absolutely on point—long drives, nights out, and some well-deserved sleep sound like the ultimate recipe for unwinding. I’d probably sneak in a dessert stop along the way—just to see that happy smile of yours 😙

I’m looking for something real and meaningful—something that starts with good conversations and maybe turns into something even better. Let me know what you think.😊
