                Hey Srujana,<br><br>
From just our little chat I can already tell you’re someone who really enjoys the little things in life that actually matter. Your perfect weekend? It sounds like something out of a rom-com but way better cuz it’s real and totally you. Coffee, brunch, shopping, sunsets, kisses, movie nights—honestly, how do I sign up to plan a weekend like that with you? 🤭

And speaking of smiles, coffee and cute texts? I couldn’t agree more. They really do hit differently, don’t they? So here’s your cute text for the day 😌.... I feel like conversations with you could be as comforting and addictive as the perfect cup of coffee.....warm, sweet, and something you keep coming back to. 

About your song—a sad romantic melody? I can’t help but wonder why sad. But, if everything goes well, maybe can try turning it into a happy romantic one someday 😊

I’m looking for something real and meaningful—letting things happen naturally and seeing how it all unfolds. 🤗
