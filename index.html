                Hey Sandla,<br><br>
                From just that short chat we had, I can already tell you’re someone amazing to talk to. It felt easy. I hope we get a chance to talk more.😊

You mentioned that tumhe khushi milti hai jab koi tumhare small details yaad rakhe... and I get that. I feel like it’s those little things that really matter, and honestly, I’d want to remember all those small things about you—like your favorite chai place, your go-to comfort food, ya phir woh song jo tum baar-baar sunte ho.🤗


Aur tumhara wo perfect song ka description—"you do whatever comes in your mind after seeing me"—I love that. If we ever meet, I’d probably do something totally random just to see you smile... like maybe challenging you to a silly game, bringing you your favorite snack out of nowhere, or even telling you the most random but funny story just to make you laugh. 🤭

Aur weekends ka toh tumne already perfect formula de diya: nashe, good laughs, aur good sleep. I’d say, let’s add one more thing to that—good company.😛

I’m looking for something real and meaningful—something that starts with good conversations and maybe turns into something even better. If you’re interested, I’d love to know more about you and see where this goes... what do you think?🌻
