So, I have this quirky habit of doing random things for people I find interesting. Do you mind if I ask a few quick questions?

If you had to describe your perfect weekend, what would it look like?

What’s one thing that can instantly put a smile on your face?

If you could describe your life in a song, what song would it be?



What’s a hobby or activity that helps you relax?



I’m working on a fun surprise for you based on what you shared. Give me an hour!



Okay, it’s all set!
hope it gives you a smile
